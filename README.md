# BookLover: Your Ultimate Library and Book Sharing App

## Project Idea

BookLover aims to be the go-to mobile application for book enthusiasts. It will function as a comprehensive digital library, housing information about books across all genres. A key feature will be the ability for users to post and share details about books they own or have read, creating a vibrant community of book lovers. Users will be able to discover new reads, explore different genres, and connect with others who share their literary tastes.

## Day-by-Day Capstone Journey Plan

This plan outlines the intended steps and timeline for the development of the BookLover application. Please note that this is a flexible plan and may be adjusted based on progress and unforeseen challenges.

**Week 1: Foundation and Planning (Starting  28th, 2025)**

* **Day 1 :** Finalize and refine the project scope and feature list. Conduct thorough market research on existing library and book-sharing apps to identify opportunities and potential challenges.
* **Day 2 :** Define the target audience and create user personas. Outline the user stories for the core functionalities of the app (browsing books, searching, user profiles, posting books).
* **Day 3 :** Design the initial wireframes and user interface (UI) sketches for the key screens of the application.
* **Day 4 :** Choose the primary technology stack for front-end (e.g., React Native, Flutter, Native Android/iOS) and back-end development (e.g., Node.js, Python/Django, Ruby on Rails). Set up the development environment.
* **Day 5 :** Begin designing the database schema to store book information, user details, and user-posted content.

**Week 2: Back-end Development - Core Functionality (Starting May 5th, 2025)**

* **Day 6 :** Start building the back-end API endpoints for user authentication (registration, login).
* **Day 7 :** Develop the API endpoints for adding new books to the database (admin or user submissions).
* **Day 8 :** Implement the API endpoints for retrieving book details based on various criteria (title, author, genre).
* **Day 9 :** Build the API endpoints to handle user profiles (creation, viewing, editing).
* **Day 10 :** Implement the functionality for users to post their own book entries with relevant details.

**Week 3: Front-end Development - User Interface (Starting May 12th, 2025)**

* **Day 11 :** Begin developing the user interface for user authentication (login and registration screens).
* **Day 12 :** Implement the UI for browsing and searching for books.
* **Day 13 :** Develop the UI to display detailed information about individual books.
* **Day 14 :** Build the user profile screens, allowing users to view and edit their information.
* **Day 15 :** Implement the UI that enables users to post their own book entries.

**Week 4: Connecting Front-end and Back-end (Starting May 19th, 2025)**

* **Day 16 :** Integrate the front-end user authentication screens with the back-end API.
* **Day 17 :** Connect the book browsing and searching functionalities in the front-end with the corresponding back-end API endpoints.
* **Day 18 :** Integrate the display of detailed book information in the front-end with the back-end data retrieval.
* **Day 19 :** Connect the user profile screens with the back-end API for data fetching and updates.
* **Day 20 :** Integrate the functionality for users to post their books from the front-end to the back-end.

**Week 5: Additional Features and Enhancements (Starting May 26th, 2025)**

* **Day 21  :** Implement a basic search functionality within user-posted books.
* **Day 22  :** Explore and potentially integrate a recommendation system based on user preferences or trending books.
* **Day 23  :** Design and implement a basic rating or review system for books.
* **Day 24  :** Focus on improving the user interface and user experience (UI/UX) based on initial testing.
* **Day 25  :** Implement basic error handling and user feedback mechanisms in the application.

**Week 6: Testing and Refinement (Starting June 2nd, 2025)**

* **Day 26 :** Conduct thorough unit testing of individual components and functions.
* **Day 27 :** Perform integration testing to ensure seamless communication between the front-end and back-end.
* **Day 28 :** Conduct user acceptance testing (UAT) with a small group of testers to gather feedback.
* **Day 29 :** Address bugs and issues identified during testing and refine the application based on feedback.
* **Day 30 :** Optimize the application for performance and stability.

**Week 7: Documentation and Finalization (Starting June 9th, 2025)**

* **Day 31 :** Write comprehensive documentation for the application, including technical details and user guides.
* **Day 32 :** Create a presentation or demonstration of the capstone project.
* **Day 33 :** Prepare all necessary files and documentation for submission.
* **Day 34 :** Final review and testing of the application and documentation.
* **Day 35 :** Finalize and submit the capstone project.

This detailed plan provides a roadmap for your capstone journey. Remember to stay organized, track your progress, and adapt the plan as needed. Good luck with BookLover!
